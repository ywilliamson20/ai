# Introduction

This website was used for a study where my team and I wanted to test if it was effective to have in situ learning for Artificial Intelligence.
We wanted to track how much they learned as they navigated through this site. They were given tasks to do before navigating the site.

### Participants could:
- search for electronics only
- add to their cart 
- checkout the items in their cart 
- watch a movie trailer for a video recommended for them
- check the bestseller list 
- look at any popups that were about AI
